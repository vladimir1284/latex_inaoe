abstract = {Formal verification is one of the most important applications of the satisfiability (SAT) problem. WSAT and its variants are one of the best performing stochastic local search algorithms. In this paper, we propose an FPGA solver for SAT-encoded verification problems based on a WSAT algorithm. The size of the verification problems is very large, and most of the data used in the algorithm have to be placed in off-chip DRAMs. The performance of the solver is limited by the throughput and access delay of the DRAMs, not by the parallelism in FPGA. We show how much speed-up is possible under this situation using the memory throughput, memory access delay and the operational frequency of FPGA as parameters.},

abstract = {It is well known that finding the shortest reduct is NP hard. In this paper, we present an heuristic fast way of finding shortest rel- ative reducts by exploring the specific nature of the input data. As a byproduct, we can show that the shortest relative reducts can be found in polynomial time, provided that we do know apriori that the lengths of the shortest reducts is bounded by a constant, that is, independent of the column size n. It should be noted that there are heuristic factors in the algorithm (“speeds” are not guaranteed) but the results, namely, the founded shortest reducts, are the precise answers.},

A lot of research work is carried out in implementing the algorithms of rough set theory using various software tools but hardware implementation of them is an area still unexplored. Hardware approach towards this will reduce the computation overhead on the main processor. We have designed and implemented a Binary Discernibility matrix and a Reduct Calculator Block of rough set processor.},

abstract = {Cost-sensitive learning is both hot and difficult in data mining and machine learning applications. Some research considers only one type of cost. Others convert two or more types of cost into the same unit, and then deal with a single-objective optimization problem. However, in many cases different types of cost cannot be converted. In this paper, we define and tackle multi-objective attribute reduct problem with multiple types of test cost. First, we compute all reducts of a decision system. Then, we separately calculate the money cost and time cost of these reducts and compare them according to the two kinds of test cost. Finally, the worse ones are removed. The remaining reducts form a Pareto optimal solution set. We tested our algorithm with three representative cost distributions on four UCI datasets. Experimental results indicate that a Pareto optimal solution set is usually very small compared with the size of all reducts. Hence our approach is effective in filtering out worse solutions and helping users in scheme selection.},

abstract = {Attribute reduction is a very important part of rough set theory. However, the cost of reduct computation is highly influenced by the size of object set and attribute set, so enhancing the reduct computation efficiency is one of the major problems. This paper proposes a reduction algorithm capable of reducing the time cost by using the binary discernibility matrix. Based on analyzing the binary discernibility matrix, the concept of attribute significance is defined at two aspects, which is applied to lead the solutions to optimization. The validity and efficiency of the proposed algorithm is verified by comparing with other two reduction algorithms on various standard domains.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a reduct construction method based on discernibility matrix simplification. The method works in a similar way to the classical Gaussian elimination method for solving a system of linear equations. Elementary matrix simplification operations are introduced. Each operation transforms a matrix into a simpler form. By applying these operations a finite number of times, one can transform a discernibility matrix into one of its minimum (i.e., the simplest) forms. Elements of a minimum discernibility matrix are either the empty set or singleton subsets, in which the union derives a reduct. With respect to an ordering of attributes, which is either computed based on a certain measure of attributes or directly given by a user, two heuristic reduct construction algorithms are presented. One algorithm attempts to exclude unimportant attributes from a reduct, and the other attempts to include important attributes in a reduct. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},
