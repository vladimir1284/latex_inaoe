\begin{abstract}
	The Testors Theory is an important approach to feature selection 
	in supervised classification. Typical testors are irreducible subsets 
	of features preserving the discernibility between objects in the 
	original dataset. A new dataset using only those features in a 
	typical testor is a reduced representation of the original one,
	which improves the efficiency of machine learning tools without 
	degrading their performance. Finding the complete set of typical 
	testors for 	a dataset requires a high computational effort. Here, 
	we propose a recursive implementation of the CT\_EXT algorithm 
	(one of the fastest reported in the literature) which avoids some 
	unnecessary verifications, reducing that way its runtime execution. 
	An experimental comparison between our proposal and other state of 
	the art algorithms, over publicly available datasets, is presented.

\section{Introduction}
%
	Feature selection is an important task in supervised classification. An 
	information system is a dataset (table) containing objects (rows) which are
	characterized by the value of some features (columns). A reduced 
	representation of an information system, with the same discernibility
	between objects than that of the original dataset, reduces the computational
	cost of the classification process. In the Logical Combinatorial Pattern 
	Recognition (Ruiz-Shulcloper et al.~\cite{Shulcloper1995}), Testors Theory 
	emerges as a solution to feature selection (Ruiz-Shulcloper~\cite{Shulcloper2008};
	Mart\'inez-Trinidad and	Guzm\'an-Arenas~\cite{Martinez2001}). A testor is subset of 
	features which allows us to discern between objects in different classes by 
	using only values of its features. A Typical Testor (TT) is defined as a testor which 
	is minimal with respect to inclusion. The main limitation to the application of
	the Testors Theory is that finding all the TT from a dataset has been proven
	as an NP-hard problem (Skowron et al.~\cite{Skowron1992}).
	
	One of the first algorithm designed to overcome the exponential complexity (regarding
	the number of features) of the problem of finding all the TT, was 
	proposed by Ruiz-Shulcloper et al.~(\cite{Shulcloper1985}). This algorithm, called BT,
	codified a subset of features as a binary word with as many bits as features in the 
	dataset. A 0 represents the absence of the corresponding feature in the current
	subset while a 1 represents its inclusion. This way, candidates subsets are evaluated
	in the natural order of binary numbers. The pruning process in the
	search space is based on the minimal condition of TT and a convenient sorting
	of the basic matrix (see definition~\ref{def:BM}) associated to the dataset. Finally, 
	testors found by BT algorithm must by compared with each other in order to remove
	any superset (not a TT by definition).
	In (Ruiz-Shulcloper et al.~\cite{Shulcloper1995b}) a new algorithm (REC) is presented.
	The main drawback of REC was that it operated directly over the dataset (instead of the
	basic matrix), handling a huge amount of superfluous information. Ayaquica~(\cite{Ayaquica1997})
	presented the algorithm CER directed to solve this problem by using a different traversing
	order. 
	
	Then, Santiesteban and Pons-Porrata~(\cite{Santiesteban2003}) proposed a revolutionary algorithm
	called LEX. Main ideas behind LEX are a new traversing order of candidates (which resembles the
	lexicographical order in which string characters are compared) and the concept of gap. In LEX
	the typical condition is verified first and only for those potentially TT, the testor 
	condition is checked. This way, the out-coming testors from this algorithm are always typical.
	The concept of gap allows us; once obtained a TT (or a not testor) candidate, including 
	the last feature in the dataset, avoid the evaluation of any subset of this candidate.
	
	Sanchez-D\'iaz and Lazo-Cort\'es~(\cite{Sanchez2007}) proposed the CT\_EXT algorithm for computing all
	TT. Following a traversing order similar to that in LEX, this algorithm search for
	testors without verifying the typical condition. This way, a larger number of candidates are 
	evaluated, in comparison to LEX; but the cost of each evaluation is lower. Results from experiments
	show that CT\_EXT is faster than the previous existing algorithm for most datasets. Then, Lias-Rodr\'iguez
	and Pons-Porrata~(\cite{Lias2009}) presented the BR algorithm, a Recursive algorithm based on 
	Binary operations. BR is very similar to LEX in its bones but its recursive nature encloses a great
	gain. Given a candidate subset, the remaining features are tested a priori and those being rejected are
	excluded from subsequent evaluations. Sanchez-D\'iaz et al.~(\cite{Sanchez2010}) presented a cumulative
	procedure for the CT\_EXT algorithm. This fast-CT\_EXT implementation reduces drastically the runtime
	for most datasets at no extra cost. In (Lias-Rodr\'iguez and Sanchez-D\'iaz~\cite{Lias2013}) the
	gap elimination and column reduction are added to BR. This fast-BR algorithm is, no doubt the one 
	evaluating the minimum number of candidates in the state of the art. The main drawback of fast-BR and 
	BR is, as in LEX, the high cost of evaluating the typical condition for every candidate. 
	
	We present in this paper recursive implementation of the fast-CT\_EXT algorithm. We show that, as 
	in BR, the a priori verification of features reduces the number of evaluated candidates. The main
	advantage of our proposed algorithm over BR is that CT\_EXT does not evaluate the typical condition,
	which leads to a runtime reduction in most cases.

\section{Basic Concepts}
%
	Let $DS$ be a dataset with $k$ objects described by $n$ condition attributes (features) and groped in
	in $r$ classes by a decision attribute. Every attribute in the set of condition attributes 
	$R=\lbrace x_1,...,x_n \rbrace$, hereinafter referred to as attributes, may be of any type and must
	have a defined comparison criterion (usually the simple equality). Let $DM$ be the binary discernibility
	matrix obtained from comparing every pair of objects in $DS$ belonging to different classes. Every 
	comparison of a pair of objects adds a row to $DM$ with (0=indiscernible,1=discernible) in the corresponding 
	attribute position (column). $DM$ has $m$ rows and $n$ columns. Comparisons generating a row with only 
	0's, hereinafter referred to as empty row, imply that two objects from different classes are indistinguishable 
	by their attributes values. These rows are called inconsistencies of $DS$ and are not included in $DM$.
	
	\begin{definition}\label{def:testor}
		Let $T \subseteq R$ be a subset of attributes form DS. We say that T is a testor if in the sub-matrix
		of DM formed by the columns corresponding to attributes in T, there is not any empty row.
	\end{definition}
	
	An empty row in this sub-matrix of $DM$ imply that a reduced dataset obtained from $DS$, using only those 
	attributes in $T$, has more inconsistencies than $DS$. 
	
	Usually the number of rows in $DM$ ($m$) is large. Lazo-Cort\'es et al.~(\cite{Lazo2001}) proposed a reduction
	of $DM$ without loosing relevant information. They proved that this reduced matrix, called basic matrix, and
	$DM$; has the same set of testors. 
	
	\begin{definition} \label{def:BM}
		Let $S_{j} \subseteq R$ be a subset of attributes associated to the row j of DM, such that $x_i \in S_{j}$
		iff the row j has a 1 in the column i. And let $SS=\lbrace S_1, S_2,...,S_m  \rbrace$ be the set of possible
		subsets $S_{j}$ in DM. The Basic Matrix BM of DS is formed by all the rows in DM (without repetitions) for 
		which its associated $S_{j}$ has not any proper subset in SS.
	\end{definition}
	
	We can then, substitute $DM$ by $BM$ in definition~\ref{def:testor} without 
	any loose of generality.
	
	\begin{definition}\label{def:TT}
		A subset of attributes $T \subseteq R$ is a typical testor iff:
		\begin{enumerate}
		\item T is a testor.
		\item $\forall x_i \in T, T \setminus x_i$ is not a testor. 
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{definition}
