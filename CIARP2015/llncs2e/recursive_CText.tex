\begin{abstract}
	Testor Theory is an important approach to feature selection in supervised classification. Typical testors are irreducible subsets of features preserving the object discernibility ability of the original set of features. However, finding the complete set of typical testors for a dataset requires a high computational effort. 
%	Recent research has unveiled the relation of typical testors finding algorithms' performance with some properties of the basic matrix. 
	In this paper, we make an empirical study involving two of the most recent and fastest algorithms of the state of the art: fast--BR and fast--CT\_EXT. Our study is carried out on synthetic basic matrices to control their density of 1's. Finally, we evaluate the conclusions drawn from this study over standard datasets from the UCI machine learning repository.

\section{Introduction}
%
	Feature selection is an important task in supervised classification. It consists in identifying those features that provide relevant information for the classification process. Feature selection may improve the efficiency of machine learning tools without significantly degrading their efficacy.	In the Logical Combinatorial Pattern Recognition~\cite{Martinez2001}, Testor Theory emerges as a solution to feature selection~\cite{Lazo2001,Shulcloper2008}. A testor is a subset of features which allows discerning between objects from different classes by using only its features. A Typical Testor (TT) is defined as a testor which is minimal with respect to inclusion. The main limitation of the Testor Theory is that finding all the TTs has exponential complexity regarding the number of attributes in the dataset~\cite{Chikalov13}.
	
	BT and TB algorithms~\cite{Shulcloper1982}, represent one of the first approaches to computing all TTs using the basic matrix. The basic matrix is a reduced representation of the comparison between all pairs of objects belonging to different classes. These algorithms codify a feature subset as a binary word with as many bits as features in the dataset. In this codification, a 1 represents the inclusion of the corresponding feature in the subset. In this way, the candidates are evaluated following the order of the binary numbers, and some candidates are avoided based on the result of previous evaluations. Several years later, a new algorithm named REC was presented~\cite{Shulcloper1995b}. The main drawback of REC is that it operates directly over the dataset (instead of the	basic matrix), handling a huge amount of superfluous information. With the purpose of resolving this issue, the CER algorithm was created~\cite{Ayaquica1997}, which also introduced a different traversing order.
	
	A new traversing order was introduced in~\cite{Santiesteban2003} for the LEX algorithm. This new traversing order (which resembles the lexicographical order in which string characters are compared) is used in the most recent and fastest algorithms for computing all TTs. This algorithm introduced also the concept of gap for its pruning process. Once obtained a TT (or a not testor) candidate which includes the last feature in the dataset, the concept of gap allows us to avoid the evaluation any subset of this candidate. In LEX the typical condition is verified first and only for those potentially TTs, the testor condition is evaluated. Later, the CT\_EXT algorithm for computing all TTs~\cite{Sanchez2007} was proposed. This algorithm searches for testors without verifying the typical condition, following the traversing order of LEX. This approach, usually leads to a larger number of candidate evaluations in comparison to LEX. However, the cost of each candidate evaluation is lower. The authors of CT\_EXT show that it is faster than the previous existing algorithm for most datasets. Then, the BR algorithm~\cite{Lias2009} was presented. This new Recursive algorithm based on Binary operations is similar to LEX but its recursive nature encloses a reduction in the number of evaluated candidates. Given a candidate subset, the remaining features (according to the lexicographical order) are tested, and those being rejected are excluded from subsequent evaluations of supersets of the current candidate.
	
	In~\cite{Sanchez2010} a cumulative procedure for the CT\_EXT algorithm was presented. This fast-CT\_EXT implementation, drastically reduces the runtime for most datasets at no extra cost. Then, in~\cite{Lias2013} the gap elimination and column reduction are added to BR, also using binary cumulative operations. The main drawback of fast-BR and BR is, as in LEX, the high cost of evaluating the typical condition for every contributing candidate. 
	
	We have described above the evolution of the so called \emph{external scale} algorithms for typical testor computation. In addition, a different line of algorithms such as CT~\cite{Bravo83}, CC~\cite{Aguila84} and YYC~\cite{Alba14} has been developed. These kind of algorithms are called \emph{internal scale} algorithms, and they analyze the basic matrix to find out some conditions to guarantee that a subset of attributes is a typical testor. Internal scale algorithms usually evaluate less candidates than external scale algorithms but each candidate evaluation has a higher computational cost. Therefore, the search for fast algorithms for computing typical testors has been biased to external scale algorithms~\cite{Alba14}.
	
	Recently, a thorough study presented in~\cite{Alba13} concluded that no single typical testor finding algorithm have the best performance for any given problem. Other studies~\cite{Lias2013,Rodriguez15}, categorize basic matrices by the density of 1's they have; i.e. the number of ones divided by the total number of cells of the matrix. Furthermore, in~\cite{Gonzalez15},  a series of elements that influence the algorithms' performance is referred. These elements are: the number of rows, the density of 1's and the number of typical testors of the basic matrix. With these precedents, in this paper we present an empirical study to identify a relationship between the density of the basic matrix and the performance of the most successful algorithms: fast--CT\_EXT~\cite{Sanchez2010} and fast--BR~\cite{Lias2013}. From this empirical study, we obtained a simple rule to determine a priory the fastest algorithm for a given dataset. Finally we validate our rule on standard datasets from the UCI dataset repository~\cite{Bache13}. 
	
	We have organized the rest of this paper in the following way. In Section~\ref{basic_conctps}, the theoretical basis for this work are introduced. In Section~\ref{study}, we present the comparative study over synthetic basic matrices and discuss the results. Then, in Section~\ref{evaluation}, the conclusions drawn from this empirical study are validated over standard datasets from the UCI machine learning repository. Finally, in Section~\ref{conclusions}, the conclusions are presented.
%
\section{Basic Concepts} \label{basic_conctps}
%
	In this section, we introduce the main concepts, definitions and propositions supporting the pruning strategies of fast--CT\_EXT and fast--BR. Here, we aim to provide the key elements to understand the differences between these two algorithms. 
	
	Let $DS$ be a dataset with $k$ objects described by $n$ attributes (features) and grouped in $r$ classes. Every attribute in the set of attributes $R=\lbrace x_1,...,x_n \rbrace$, may be of any type and has a predefined comparison criterion (usually the simple equality). Let $DM$ be the binary comparison matrix obtained from comparing every pair of objects in $DS$ belonging to different classes. Every comparison of a pair of objects adds a row to $DM$ with 0=equal,1=different in the corresponding attribute position (column). $DM$ has $m$ rows and $n$ columns. Comparisons generating a row with only 0's, hereinafter referred to as empty row, imply that two objects from different classes are equal according to their attributes values. 
	
	\begin{definition}\label{def:testor}
		Let $T \subseteq R$ be a subset of attributes from $DS$. We say that T is a testor if in the sub-matrix
		of DM formed by the columns corresponding to attributes in T, there is not any empty row.
	\end{definition} 	
	
	Usually the number of rows in $DM$ ($m$) is large. In~\cite{Lazo2001} a reduction of $DM$ without loss of relevant information is proposed, and they proved that this reduced matrix, called \textit{basic matrix} ($BM$), and $DM$; have the same set of testors. Then, we can substitute $DM$ by $BM$ in the definition~\ref{def:testor} without any loss of generality. 	
	
	\begin{definition}\label{def:TT}
		A subset of attributes $T \subseteq R$ is a typical testor in BM iff T is a testor and $\forall x_i \in T, T \setminus x_i$ is not a testor. 
	\end{definition}
		
%	
\subsection{Concepts for fast--CT\_EXT}
%
		
	\begin{definition}\label{def:contrib}
		Given $T \subseteq R$ and $x_i \in R$ such that $x_i \notin T$. We say that $x_i$ contributes to T iff the sub-matrix of BM formed with only those attributes in T has more empty rows than that formed with attributes in $T \cup \lbrace x_i \rbrace$.
	\end{definition}	
	
	The core of the CT\_EXT algorithm is supported by propositions~\ref{prop:contrib} and~\ref{prop:superset}; which are stated and proved in~\cite{Sanchez2010} (Theorems 1 and 2 respectively).
	
	\begin{proposition}\label{prop:contrib} 
		Given $T \subseteq R$ and  $x_i \in R$ such that $x_i \notin T$. If $x_i$ does not contribute to T, then 		$T\cup\{x_i\}$ cannot be a subset of any typical testor.
	\end{proposition}

	\begin{proposition}\label{prop:superset} 
		Given $T \subseteq R$ and $Z \subseteq R$ such that $Z \cap T = \emptyset$. If T is a testor, then $T \cup Z$ is a 	testor too, but it is not a typical testor.
	\end{proposition}

%
\subsection{Concepts for fast--BR}
%
	In addition to the propositions exposed above, fast--BR is supported by the following propositions; which are stated and proved in~\cite{Lias2013}.
	
	\begin{definition}\label{def:exclusion}
		Given $T \subseteq R$. We call compatibility mask of $T$, denoted as $cm_T$, to the binary word in which the $j^{\mathit{th}}$ bit is 1 if the $j^{\mathit{th}}$ row of $BM$ has a 1 in only one of the columns corresponding to attributes in $T$, and otherwise it is 0.
	\end{definition}
	
	\begin{proposition}\label{prop:exclude} 
		Given $T \subseteq R$ and $x_i \in R$ such that $x_i \notin T$.	We denote $c_{x_k}$ to the binary word in which the $j^{\mathit{th}}$ bit is 1 if the $j^{\mathit{th}}$ row of $BM$ has a 1 in the column corresponding to $x_k$. If $\exists x_k \in T$ such that $cm_{T \cup \lbrace x_i\rbrace} \wedge c_{x_k}=(0,...,0)$. Then, $T \cup \lbrace x_i\rbrace$ cannot be a subset of any typical testor, and we will say that $x_i$ is exclusionary with $T$.
	\end{proposition}
	
	We will refer to Proposition~\ref{prop:exclude} as exclusion evaluation. The application of the exclusion evaluation for typical testor property identification is given in the form of Proposition~\ref{prop:TT}.
	
	\begin{proposition}\label{prop:TT} 
			Given $T \subseteq R$ and $x_i \in R$ such that $x_i \notin T$. The subset $T \cup \lbrace x_i\rbrace$ is a typical testor iff it is a testor and $x_i$ is not exclusionary with $T$.
	\end{proposition}
		
%
\section{Comparative Study} \label{study}
%
	  From our literature review, we found two families of external scale algorithms: those evaluating first the testor condition and then verifying the typical condition (exclusion evaluation)~\cite{Shulcloper1982,Sanchez2007,Sanchez2010}, and those evaluating the exclusion first and then the testor condition~\cite{Santiesteban2003,Lias2009,Lias2013}. We include in our comparative study the main exponents of these two families: fast--CT\_EXT and fast--BR, respectively. Their candidate evaluation process is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:candeval}.  Since the number of testors is usually a small fraction of the total evaluated candidates, we can state that most of the times fast--BR makes more exclusion evaluations than fast--CT\_EXT. For our experimental study in the next section; we will use, for both algorithms, the implementations provided by their authors\footnote{The source code as well as all the basic matrices and datasets used in our experiments can be downloaded from \url{http://ccc.inaoep.mx/~ariel/CTBRES}}.

	\end{figure}

\subsection{Comparison over synthetic basic matrices}
%
	This first experment was designed to explore the influence of the basic matrix density, i.e., the number of ones divided by the total number of cells of the matrix; on the relative performance of fast--CT\_EXT and fast--BR. We conducted this experiment over 500 randomly generated basic matrices with 2000 rows and 30 columns. The size of these matrices was selected in order to keep reasonable runtime for both algorithms. Our 500 matrices were generated with densities of 1's uniformly distributed in the range (0.16--0.80) using a step of 0.04. 

	\begin{figure}[htb]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[height=6cm]{2000rows.eps}	        
		\caption{Runtime vs. density for basic matrices with 2000 rows and 30 columns.}
		\label{fig:density}
	\end{figure}

	From Fig.~\ref{fig:density}, it can be seen that fast--CT\_EXT was faster for basic matrices with density under 0.29, while fast--BR was faster for matrices with density above 0.29. We used a third degree polynomial last square fit of each algorithm's runtime to determine this intersection in the density value of 0.31. To understand this behavior, we must look back to Fig.~\ref{fig:candeval}. The exclusion evaluation has the higher computational complexity in both algorithms $\Theta (nm)$. Exclusionary attributes are found when there is at least one column in the basic matrix, considering only those attributes in the current candidate, that can be removed without increasing the number of zero rows. This condition is more frequent in matrices with higher density, where overlapping of 1's is most likely. For matrices with a relative high density, the heavier candidate evaluation process of fast--BR pays off, because exclusionary attributes are avoided from subsequent evaluations. For matrices with lower density, the simpler approach of fast--CT\_EXT results in a faster execution.
%	 Take for instance the extreme case of the identity matrix, where there is not any exclusionary attribute, since they are all indispensable to form a typical testor. For this kind of basic matrices, fast--CT\_EXT needs to evaluate as many candidates as fast--BR but the former makes a single exclusion evaluation with the set of all attributes. On the other hand, fast--BR evaluates the exclusion for each candidate, which leads to a higher computational cost.
	
	For basic matrices with a density value close to the boundary of 0.31 any algorithm can be the fastest; but we may expect a small runtime difference. The overlapping of algorithms' runtime for this region can be seen in  Fig.~\ref{fig:density}. Thus, we conclude that other properties of the basic matrix than the density, have influence in the algorithm's performance. Since we controlled in our experiment the matrix size, these properties should be related to the position of 1's in the basic matrix.
%
\section{Evaluation on standard datasets} \label{evaluation}
	In order to evaluate the rule obtained from synthetic basic matrices, we selected 10 datasets from the UCI database repository~\cite{Bache13}. The first four datasets have basic matrix densities clearly under 0.31, the fifth dataset  (mushroom) is close to this value and the last five datasets have densities clearly above 0.31. Numerical attributes were discretized using the Weka's equal width discretization filter with 10 bins, as describe in~\cite{Flores2010}.

		\end{tabular}
	\end{table}
	
	Table~\ref{tab:density} shows the number of attributes and instances for each dataset, the number of rows and the density of the basic matrix, the number of typical testors and the runtime for fast--CT\_EXT and fast--BR. The last column shows the fraction (in percent) of the smallest over the greatest runtime for each dataset. Datasets in Table~\ref{tab:density} are sorted by the density of the basic matrix. 
	
	We can see from these results that the rule obtained from synthetic matrices is verified over standard datasets. Notice that for the mushroom dataset, any algorithm can be the fastest, according to our previous study. Indeed, for this particular dataset, the greatest runtime fraction was obtained; indicating a similar performance of both algorithms. This fact corroborates our predictions for the boundary region. Another interesting result is that for those datasets with a density clearly above 0.31, fast--BR reached very low runtime fractions. This huge runtime reduction cannot be observed in Fig.~\ref{fig:density}. Thus, we believe that this behaviour is related to the heterogeneous basic matrix dimensions that we have in this experiments. Notice in Table~\ref{tab:density} that the lower ratios in the last column are connected to higher matrix dimensions.

\section{Conclusions} \label{conclusions}
%
 This paper presents an empirical study on the performance of two typical testor finding algorithms, regarding the density of 1's of the basic matrix. We selected for this study the main exponents of two candidate evaluations strategies for external scale algorithms: fast--CT\_EXT and fast--BR. A set of synthetic matrices were used to explore their performance. From our experimental results, we obtained a simple rule for selecting a priori the fastest algorithm for a given dataset. Then, we evaluated this rule over standard datasets from the UCI database repository. We think, however, that the main contribution of this paper is the introduction of a new approach to assess typical testor finding algorithms' performance. This approach provides more substantial information than the traditional evaluation over a random sample of datasets.
 
 The evaluation over standard datasets, unveiled greater runtime reductions of fast--BR for basic matrices with larger size. Thus, future work can be directed to study the algorithms' relative performance regarding the number of rows and columns in the basic matrix.
