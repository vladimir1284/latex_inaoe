  \opening{Dear Editor in Chief and Reviewers:}

  We are pleased to resubmit a new version of our paper INS-D-16-1281R2: A New Algorithm for Reduct Computation based on Gap Elimination and Attribute Contribution. We want to thank the constructive criticisms of the editor and reviewers as well as their comments and questions. We have modified the original paper accordingly to the reviewer comments and we hope that, in its present form, the paper can be accepted. We have addressed the editor and reviewers concerns as outlined below.

  \textbf{Editor:} 
  The linguistic quality needs improvement. It is essential to make sure that  the manuscript reads smoothly- this definitely helps the reader fully appreciate your research findings. Consult a professional. 
  \begin{enumerate}
	\item Show all changes made to the revised manuscript. \\
	\textbf{Authors’ response:} \\
	We have proofread the whole paper in order to improve the grammar in the current version of the paper. The changes accomplished to this end are summarized below:
	\begin{itemize}		
		\item We made slight modifications to the last two sentences of the abstract to improve its readability.
		 
		\item We have rewritten the last sentence of the subsection ``Positive Region"  for clarity purposes. This sentence is reproduced below in its current form:
		
		The set $POS_B(D)$, called the \textit{B-positive region of D}, is defined as the set of all objects in $U$ such that if two of them have the same value for each attribute in B, they belong to the same decision class.
		
		\item We have improved the grammar of the last paragraph in page 8 as it can be seen below.
		
		Following a traversing order similar to that one used for LEX, the algorithm CT\_EXT searches for testors without verifying the typical condition. In this way, a larger number of candidates is evaluated, in comparison to LEX; but the cost of each evaluation is lower.
		
		\item In the fourth paragraph of the subsection ``Pruning Properties for GCreduct", we have corrected the grammar of the following sentence:
		
		Notice that the order of the elements in the list is relevant.
		 
		\item Another grammar correction was made in the fifth paragraph of the subsection ``Pruning Properties for GCreduct", as it can be seen below:
		
		Let us also define an order relation $\prec$ over the set of ordered lists of attributes as follows.
		
		\item Slight modifications were introduced in Propositions~\ref{prop:gap}, \ref{prop:contrib}, \ref{prop:cumul}, \ref{prop:exclude} and \ref{prop:firstRow}, Corollary~\ref{coro:gap} and Definition~\ref{coro:gap}, to improve their grammar.  
		
		\item The grammar of the penultimate paragraph of the subsection ``Pruning Properties for GCreduct" was improved as follows.
		
		Based on this proposition, if we reach an ordered list $L$ satisfying $c_{j_0}=0$, the search can be stopped.
		
		\item The last sentence from the first paragraph of the subsection ``The algorithm GCreduct" was improved as it can be seen below.
		
		...GCreduct uses a simpler candidate evaluation based on attribute contribution and gap elimination to reduce the runtime. 
		
		\item We have improved the grammar of the first sentence in the penultimate paragraph of page~18. This sentence can be seen below in its current form.
		
		The pseudocode for the exclusion evaluation is shown in Algorithm~\ref{alg:exclusion}.
		
		\item We have also made changes to the first paragraph of page 20, as it can be seen below.
		
		Thus, there is no  polynomial complexity algorithm for computing all the reducts of a decision system. However, the performance of the algorithms for computing all reducts is strongly related to the characteristics of the \textit{SBDM}. 
		
		\item The first sentence in the first paragraph of page~23 was fixed as follows:
		
		The exclusion verification starts with $cm_B = em_B = (00000)$.
		
		\item The third paragraph from section ``Evaluation and Discussion" was modified for clarity purposes, as it can be seen below.
		
		The source code of the four algorithms, as well as all the decision systems from UCI and the synthetic \textit{SBDMs} used in these experiments, are available at \url{http://ccc.inaoep.mx/~ariel/GCreduct}.
		
		\item The grammar of the second paragraph from the subsection ``Evaluation Over Synthetic \textit{SBDMs}" was improved as follows:
		
		For clarity purposes, the 500 matrices were divided into 15 groups by discretizing the range of densities, each group having approximately 33 \textit{SBDMs}. Figure~\ref{fig:scattDensity} shows the average runtime for all  matrices in each group for the three algorithms, as a function of the density of 1's in the synthetic \textit{SBDMs}. In this figure, the vertical bars show the standard deviation of each bin. 
		
		\item We have improved the grammar of the last paragraph in page 27 as it can be seen below.
		
		This operation is executed more often in fast--BR than in GCreduct.\\
		
		For this kind of \textit{SBDMs}, GCreduct needs to evaluate as many candidates as fast--BR but the former one makes a single verification for exclusion with the set of all attributes.
		
		\item The last sentence of the second paragraph in page~28 was rewritten as it can be seen below.
		
		Moreover, from these conclusions a great advantage can be taken of selecting the appropriate algorithm for each decision system, since the density of 1's can be computed a priori with a relatively low computational cost.
		
		\item The last sentence from the subsection ``Evaluation Over Synthetic \textit{SBDMs}" was fixed as follows:
		
		However, for density values not too close to 0.36 these variations in the distribution of 1's within the \textit{SBDMs} have no effect on the determination of the fastest algorithm, as it can be also seen in Figure~\ref{fig:scattDensity}.
		
		\item The second and third paragraph of the conclusions were modified to improve their grammar and clarity.
		
	\end{itemize}
		 
	\item Shorten the paper - 35 pages max.\\
	\textbf{Authors’ response:} \\
	The paper was modified to fit the 35 pages. The following modifications were made to this end:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item We removed the third paragraph from the Introduction where we discussed some recent applications of the algorithms for computing all reducts.
		
		\item From the  Basic Concepts, we removed the second paragraph where we introduced the meaning of indistinguishable objects. This term will be not used further in the current version of the paper.

		
		\item We have shorten the ``Related Work" section by eliminating the discussion of some previous works that we found less related to our proposed algorithm.
		
		\item From the subsection ``The algorithm GCreduct", we removed the proposition where we explicitly show that the algorithm GCreduct finds all the reducts of a decision system. 
		
		\item We have shorten the subsection ``GCreduct vs. fast--CT\_EXT and fast--BR" by including the information shown in Table~9 (Candidates evaluated by Fast--CT\_EXT, GCreduct and Fast--BR for decision systems from UCI) within Table~8 (Candidates evaluated by Fast--CT\_EXT, GCreduct and Fast--BR for decision systems from UCI). We also eliminated the Figure~1 (GCreduct fraction of evaluated candidates vs. the number of attributes of the decision systems) since the information shown in this figure is implicit in the new Table~\ref{tab:java} (Runtime and candidates evaluated by Fast--CT\_EXT, GCreduct and Fast--BR for decision systems from UCI).
		
		
	\end{itemize}
  \end{enumerate}
  
  \textbf{Reviewer \#3:}
  
  The article ``A New Algorithm for Reduct Computation based on Gap Elimination and Attribute Contribution" submitted by you to the Information Sciences journal is, in my opinion, ready for publication and I recommended to accept this work. 
  
  In my opinion, you have greatly improved the quality of the paper, by taking into account the comments of the reviewers. Nevertheless, I was hesitating a bit, between the `minor revision' and `acceptance' of the paper since there are still a few, minor shortcomings. However, the list of my remarks is short and the severity of them is low, hence I believe that all shortcomings may be improved by you during the work on the camera ready version (if the final decision would be the acceptance of the article). Below you may find my remarks:  
 
 \begin{enumerate}  
	\item (page 5) you still confuse Information System with Decision System - see Table~1: ``Example of an Information System, where $c_0 - c_6$ are condition attributes and $d$ is a decision attribute".\\
	\textbf{Authors’ response:} \\	
	We agree this remark and we modified the caption of Table~\ref{tab_IS} as ``Example of a Decision System, where $c_0-c_6$ are conditional attributes and $d$ is a decision attribute.".
	
	\item condition attributes $=>$ conditional attributes.\\
	\textbf{Authors’ response:}\\
	To attend this suggestion, we replaced condition attribute/s by conditional attribute/s wherever appropriate.
	
	\item (page 6) Definition 1 should be corrected: $r_1 => r_k.$\\
	\textbf{Authors’ response:}\\
	We specially thank the reviewer for this remark since this error in the definition causes confusion to the reader. We made the corrections, and the definition in its new form is shown below.
	
	\begin{definition}\label{def:basic_row}
		Let $DM$ be a binary discernibility matrix and $r_k \in DM$ be a row of $DM$. We say that $r_k$ is a superfluous row of $DM$ if $\exists r \in DM$ such that $\exists i | (r[i] < r_k[i]) \wedge \forall i | (r[i] \leq r_k[i])$, where $r[i]$ is the $i$-th element of the row $r$.
		
	\end{definition}	 
	
	\item (page 35) There are still some issues with the article language, i.e.: ``within the SBDM have not effect on the determination of the fastest algorithm" $=>$ ..have no effect on the determination.. or ..have not affected the determination..\\
	\textbf{Authors’ response:}\\
	The sentence was corrected as follows:
	
	However, for density values not too close to 0.36 these variations in the distribution of 1's within the \textit{SBDMs} have no effect on the determination of the fastest algorithm, as it can be also seen in Figure~\ref{fig:scattDensity}.
	
	\item (page 35) In my opinion the conclusion ``we can conclude that GCreduct performs faster than the fastest previously reported algorithms" should be rephrased to $=>$  ..GCreduct performs faster than: fast-BR, ..."\\
	\textbf{Authors’ response:}\\
	We modified this sentence to address this remark as it can be seen below.
	
	After conducting a series of experiments over synthetic \textit{SBDMs} and decision systems from the UCI repository, we can conclude that GCreduct performs faster than fast--BR and fast--CT\_EXT on those decision systems whose associated \textit{SBDM} has a density of 1's under 0.36.
	
  \end{enumerate}     
  
  Best regards,

  The authors.
