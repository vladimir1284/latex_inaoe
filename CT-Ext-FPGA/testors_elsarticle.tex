\begin{abstract}
In pattern recognition, feature selection is a very important task
for supervised classification. The problem consists in, given a
dataset where each object is described by a set of features, finding
a subset of the original features such that a classifier that runs
on data containing only these features would reach high
classification accuracy. A useful way to find this subset of the
original features is through Testor Theory. A testor is defined as a
subset of the original features that allows differentiating objects
from different classes. Testors are very useful particularly when
object descriptions contain both numeric and non-numeric features.
Computing testors for feature selection is a very complex problem
due to exponential complexity, with respect to the number of
features, of algorithms based on testor theory. Hardware
implementation of testor computing algorithms helps to improve their
performance taking advantage of parallel processing for verifying if
a feature subset is a testor in a single clock cycle. This paper
introduces an efficient hardware-software platform for computing
irreducible testors for feature selection in pattern recognition.
Results of implementing the proposed platform using a FPGA-based
prototyping board are presented and discussed.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sect:1}

Reconfigurable computing based on the combination of conventional
microprocessors and field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), has
become increasingly popular for implementing special-purpose
hardware to accelerate complex tasks. Usually an FPGA-based
implementation is embedded in a PC or workstation, which drives its
activity and manages the results. Following this trend, we developed
an efficient hardware-software platform for computing irreducible
testors \citep{R1} for feature selection in pattern recognition
\citep{R2,R3,R17,R18,R19}.

The feature selection problem in pattern recognition consists in,
given a dataset where each object is described by a set of features,
finding a subset of the original features such that a classifier
that runs on data containing only these features would reach higher
classification accuracy. This procedure can reduce not only the cost
of recognition by reducing the number of features to be collected,
but in some cases it can also provide better classification
accuracy. For this task, a higher performance with lower
computational effort is expected \citep{R2}. Several algorithms have
been proposed for feature selection, however, most of them were
developed for numeric features \citep{R3,R4}. 
% adecuate these sentences %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
We chose CT-EXT, an algorithm based on testor theory, which can be applied on datasets
described with both numeric and non-numeric features, even when
there are missing data. Although the theoretical aspect of computing
irreducible testors is advanced \citep{R5,R6,R7,R8,R9}, there are
not practical hardware implementations reported previously,
excepting our previous works.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% add news improvements and correct some sentences %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In our first work, an architectural design based on a brute force approach for computing testors was proposed
\citep{R10}. In this first approach, each candidate was generated by a counter that incremented its value by
1 on each iteration. The architecture is able to evaluate if a candidate is a testor in a single clock cycle,
however, the architecture did not exploit the characteristics of a particular data set that could allow to
significantly reduce the number of candidates tested.  The next step in our architectural design \citep{R11}
was the implementation of BT algorithm for computing testors where a candidate generator that jumps over
unnecessary candidates allows reducing the number of comparisons needed in the brute force approach. These
two previous works compute the whole set of testors, however for pattern recognition applications where
testor theory can be applied, it is important to obtain only testors that are irreducible. Thus, as the next step in our design, in \citep{R21} we proposed a hardware-software platform for computing only irreducible testors.
This platform consisted of the combination of a specialized hardware architecture that was implemented on a
commercial FPGA-based prototyping board and a host application running on a PC. The architecture implemented
the BT algorithm, as in \citep{R11}, but it also included a new module that eliminates most of the testors
that are not irreducible before transferring them to the host application for final processing.
In this work we present an architecture that implements the CT-EXT algorithm and is capable of finding only irreducible testors. The CT-EXT algorithm has proven more efficient in finding typical testors than BT algorithm in most cases \citep{R22, R23}.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The intensive computational requirements due to the exponential
complexity, with respect to the number of features, of the testor
theory based algorithms can be met by a combination of technological
improvements and efficient hardware architectures based on parallel
computational models. Specific parallel architectures can be
designed to exploit the parallelism found in the irreducible testor
computing algorithms. Further optimizations such as incremental
processing and the use of multiple processing elements are also
possible.

\section{Basic concepts}
\label{sect:2}

In pattern recognition, feature selection is a very important task for supervised classification. A useful
way to do this selection is through Testor Theory. The concept of testor for pattern recognition was
introduced by Dmitriev et al. in 1966 \citep{R12}. They defined a testor as a subset of features that allows
differentiating objects from different classes. Testors are quite useful, especially when object descriptions
contain both numeric and nonnumeric features, and maybe they are incomplete (mixed incomplete data)
\citep{R5}.

Let $TM$ be a training matrix with $K$ objects described through $N$
features of any type $(x_{1},\ldots,x_{N})$ and grouped in $r$
classes. Let $DM$ be a dissimilarity Boolean matrix (0 = similar,1 =
dissimilar), obtained from feature by feature comparisons of every
pair of objects from $TM$ belonging to different classes. $DM$ has
$N$ columns and $M$ rows, where $M>>K$.

Testors and irreducible testors are defined as follows:

\begin{definition} \label{def1}
A subset of features $T$ is a testor if and only if when all
features are eliminated from $DM$, except those from $T$, there is
not any row of $DM$ with only 0´s.
\end{definition}


\begin{definition} \label{def2}
A subset of features $T$ is an irreducible testor if and only if $T$
is a testor and there is not any other testor $T'$ such that
$T'\subset T$.
\end{definition}

In defintion \ref{def1}, if there is not any row of $DM$ with only
0's it means that there is not a pair of objects from different
classes that are similar on all the features of $T$, that is, a
testor $T$ allows differentiating between objects from different
classes.

The number of rows in $DM$ could be too large, therefore a strategy to reduce this matrix without losing
relevant information for computing irreducible testors was introduced by Lazo et al \citep{R1}.

\begin{definition} \label{def3}
If $t$ and $p$ are two rows of $DM$, then $p$ is a sub-row of $t$ if and only if:


\begin{enumerate}
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{\alph{enumi})}
\item $t$ has 1 everywhere $p$ has 1
\item there is at least one column such that $t$ has 1 and $p$ has 0
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition} \label{def4}
A row $t$ of $DM$ is a basic row of $DM$ if and only if $DM$ does
not have any other row $t' $ such that $t' $ is a sub-row of $t$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition} \label{def5}
The matrix that contains only the basic rows of $DM$ is called basic
matrix and is denoted by $BM$.
\end{definition}

Let $TT(M)$ be the set of all irreducible testors of the Boolean matrix M, then

\begin{proposition}
$TT(DM)=TT(BM)$.
\end{proposition}

This proposition indicates that the set of all irreducible testors calculated using $DM$ or $BM$ is the same
\citep{R1}. However, $BM$ is smaller than $DM$ and the construction of $BM$ from $DM$ is a very fast process,
for example, the time for obtaining a $BM$ matrix with 48 columns and 32 rows from a $DM$ matrix with 48
columns and 193,753 rows, is about 0.21 seconds on a PC with an Intel Centrino Duo processor running at
1.6GHz, with 1024 MB of RAM.

The CT-EXT has the following theoretical bases.
\begin{definition} \label{def21} Let $f_i$ be a row of BM. We say that $f_i$ is a zero row of $S \subseteq R$, and we denote it by ${f_i}^0 (S)$, if $\forall X_p \in S$, $f_i [p] = BM [i, p] = 0$.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition} \label{def22} In terms of BM, a testor $T \subseteq R$ is a feature set such that there
are no zero rows of T in BM. 
\end{definition}
From this definition, if T is a testor then, any superset of T is a testor too.
\begin{definition} \label{def23} Let $f_i$ be a row of BM. We say that $f_i$ is a typical (irreducible) row of $S \subseteq R$ with regard to $X_q$ , and we denote it by ${f_i}^1 (S,q)$ if $\exists X_q \in S$, such that $f_i [q] = BM [i, q] = 1$, and $\forall X_p \in S$, $X_p \neq X_q$ , $f_i [p] = BM [i, p] =~0$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition} \label{def24} In terms of BM, $T \subseteq R$ is a typical testor if T is a testor and
$\forall X_j \in T, \exists {f_i}^1 (T, j)$.
\end{definition}

This means that in a typical testor, for all features, there exists a row in BM in
the sub matrix associated to T, having a value of 1 in the position corresponding
to that feature, and values of 0 in all remaining positions (there are no zero rows,
and if any column of T is eliminated, at least one zero row appears, and the testor
property is not fulfilled). Although we have defined a typical testor here in terms
of BM, normally it is defined as an irreducible testor (as in definition~\ref{def2}).

\begin{definition} \label{def25} Let $T \subseteq R$ and $X_j \in R$, $X_j \neq T$. We denote by
$\sum_T f^0$ the number of zero rows of T. We say that $X_j$ contributes to T if, and only if,
$\sum_{T\cup\{X_j\}} f^0 < \sum_T f^0$.
\end{definition}
This definition indicates that one feature contributes to a feature combination
if for some zero rows in BM, considering only T, the new feature has a value of
1 in at least one of these zero rows. So, adding this feature to T, there are less
zero rows of the incremented feature combination than of T.

Being $T \subset T\cup\{X_j\}$, it is not possible that $\sum_T f^0 < \sum_{T\cup\{X_j\}} f^0$. If we
increase the feature combination either the zero rows are maintained and in this
case the column added does not contribute to the combination, or the number of zero rows decreases.

\begin{proposition}\label{prop1} Let $T \subseteq R$ and  $X_j \in R$, $X_j \neq T$. If $X_j$ does not contribute to
T, then $T\cup\{X_j\}$ can not generate any typical testor.
\end{proposition}

\textit{Proof}. Let $T \subseteq R$ and $X_j \in R$, such that $X_j$ does not contribute to T. Suppose
that $T' = T\cup\{X_j \cup Z\}$ is a typical testor. Then, according to definition \ref{def24}, there
exists for $X_j$ at least a typical row in BM. Then, $f_i [j] = BM [i, j] = 1$, and
$\forall X_p \in T'$ , $X_p \neq X_j$ , $f_i [p] = BM [i, p] = 0$. Thus, we have that $f_i$ is a zero row
of $T \cup Z$ and therefore, of T too. So, $\sum_{T\cup\{X_j\}} f^0 < \sum_T f^0$ and we obtain that
$X_j$ contributes to T, which contradicts the formulated hypothesis and then, we
have that there are no typical testors that include $T\cup\{X_j\}$.

\begin{proposition}\label{prop2} Let $T \subseteq R$, $Z \subseteq R$, $Z \neq \emptyset$. If T is a testor, then $T \cup Z$ is a testor too, but it is not a typical testor.
\end{proposition}

\textit{Proof}. Being T a testor, we have that $\sum_T f^0 = 0$, therefore, any feature $X_p \in Z$
contributes to T. Since $T \cup Z$ is a superset of T, then $T \cup Z$ is a testor, but
following proposition~\ref{prop1}, it can not generate any typical testor.
\subsection*{Description of the CT-EXT algorithm}
%\texttt{
%\textbf{Input:} BM (Basic Matrix)\\
%\textbf{Output:} TT (set of all typical testors)}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The row with less quantity of 1's, is set as the first row of BM. The columns of BM are ordered, from left to right, each having a value of 1 in the first row and each subsequent column having a value 0 in the first row of BM. The order of the columns into each group (with the same value of 1 or with the same value of 0) is irrelevant.

\item Let the set TT = \{~\} (initialized as empty set, it will be the typical testors set) and the list T = [~]  (current feature combination); j = 1 (first feature of BM to be analyzed).

\item If $X_j$ has a value of 1 in the first row of BM then $X_j$ is added to T $(T = T [X_j])$, go to
step 5; otherwise, the algorithm finishes (any new feature combination
will not generate a typical testor, because all these combinations have a zero row).
The new feature is added to the current

\item The new feature is added to the current combination ($T = T \cup \{X_j\}$), and it is verified whether this new feature contributes to the current combination. If the answer is negative, go to step 6.

\item Verify whether T is a testor, if yes then verify whether it is a typical testor. If T is a typical testor, the combination is saved in TT ($TT = TT \cup T $). If this is not the case, go to step 7.

\item The last feature analysed $X_j$ is eliminated from T ($T = T \setminus \{Xj\}$). If $X_j$ does not contribute
to T, then no combination containing T is verified (proposition \ref{prop1}). Go to step 7. If the
 combination was a testor, then no consecutive superset of the current combination is analysed 
 (proposition \ref{prop2}). If $T = \emptyset$ then $j = j + 1$, go to step 3.
 
\item The next non-analysed feature in the current combination is selected. If $j < n$ then $j = j + 1$, 
and go to step 4; otherwise, go to step 6.
\end{enumerate}

For example consider the basic matrix of Table~\ref{table1}, with N=5 attributes and M=3 rows. After ordering step we obtain the basic matrix of Table~\ref{table2}. Table~\ref{tab_example} illustrates solution process.

\section{Proposed platform}
\label{sect:3}

Since algorithms for computing all irreducible testors have
exponential complexity, with respect to the number of columns in
$BM$, software based implementations do not provide reasonable
performance for practical problems. An interesting alternative is to
migrate to custom hardware architectures based on programmable logic
to take advantage of the parallelism inherent in this type of
algorithms. 
This work is a continuation of our previous work
\citep{R10,R11,R21} and reports the development of a
hardware-software platform for computing irreducible testors using
the CT-EXT algorithm. 
The proposed platform is shown in
Fig.\,\ref{figArq}. A description of all the platform modules is
given in the next sections.

\caption{CT-EXT Architecture.}
\label{fig:3}
\end{figure}

The process of deciding if an $N$-tuple is a testor of $BM$ involves
comparing the candidate against each one of the $BM$'s rows. For
software-only implementations, this is a big disadvantage, in
particular for large matrices with many rows. The proposed hardware
architecture exploits the parallelism inherent in the CT-EXT algorithm
and evaluates whether a candidate is an irreducible testor or not in a single
clock cycle. It is composed by two main modules as seen in
Fig.\,\ref{fig:3}. 

The BM module stores the input matrix and
includes logic to decide if an $N$-tuple is a testor. The candidate
generator module produces the candidates ($N$-tuples) to be
evaluated by the BM module. In order to calculate the next candidate
according to the BT algorithm, the architecture feedbacks the
evaluation result of the previous candidate to the generator module,
this allows to drastically reduce the number of candidates tested
thus the number of iterations needed by the algorithm. At this
point, the architecture is able to obtain all testors of $BM$,
however since only irreducible testors are of interest, a final
hardware processing module eliminates most of the testors that are
not irreducible before sending the remaining testors to the software
for final processing. The dismiss module exploits the way
consecutive testors are obtained. If a testor is a superset of at
least one previous testor, it is not an irreducible testor, thus it
is eliminated. This final process does not introduce delays, thus
the architecture is still capable of evaluating a candidate in a
single clock cycle.

\label{fig:4}
\end{figure}

The BM module is composed of $M$ sub-modules named \textit{row~x}, as shown
in Fig.\,\ref{fig:4}. Each \textit{row~x} module contains a row ($N$ bits)
of the $BM$ matrix and logic to perform testor evaluation. To decide
if an $N$-tuple is a testor, a bitwise AND operation is performed
between the constant stored in each \textit{row~x} module and the current
candidate as shown in Fig.\,\ref{fig:row}. If at least one bit of the AND operation result is TRUE,
then the output \textit{Testor} of that particular \textit{row~x} sub-module
will be TRUE. The same operation is performed over the previous candidate.
If the count of rows asserting the output \textit{Testor} is different from
the those asserting the output \textit{Contributes} of that particular \textit{row~x} sub-module, 
then output \textit{Contributes} from the BM module is TRUE.
If the outputs of all  \textit{row~x} sub-modules are
TRUE, then the output \textit{Testor} of the BM module will be TRUE,
which means that the candidate is declared a testor of $BM$.

\caption{BM row.}
\label{fig:row}
\end{figure}

In order to check for irreducible condition of testors, the module \textit{N to N decoder}
receives as input the result of AND operation between the current candidate and the $BM$ row.
The output from module \textit{N to N decoder} repeats the input in case there is only one bit set
in it, and returns zero otherwise. For those rows with only one bit set after anded with candidate,
attribute in the position of setted bit is indispensable in case of candidate been a testor.
According to definition~\ref{def2}, every attribute in a testor should be indispensable to be an
irreducible testor. This idea is stated in definition~1 of \citep{R13}.

Take for example the ordered basic matrix in table~\ref{table2}. In the table~\ref{table4} the irreducibility of candidate $(x_0 x_1)$ is evaluated while did the same for candidate $(x_0 x_4)$ in table~\ref{table5}. In left rows the result of the AND operation between each row of $BM$ and the candidate, while those in the right show decoder output taking as input the cell in its left. In the lower right corner the result of OR operation over all cells above is shown. According to our previous explanation, candidate $(x_0 x_1)$ is an irreducible testor been equal to the OR operation result while candidate $(x_0 x_4)$ isn't. This can be corroborated in table~\ref{tab_example}.

\end{figure}

The candidate generator module uses the feedback from the BM module
to calculate the next candidate to be evaluated. The
candidate generator module (Fig.\,\ref{fig:5}) consists of three
registers for holding the current candidate (\textit{Curr$\_$cand}), the previous candidate
(\textit{Prev$\_$cand}) and the last added attribute ($J$). These registers values are updated
by the modules EA1, EA2 and A.

Depending on the combination of inputs values, outputs are taken E1A,
E2A or A to update the records accordingly. Table~\ref{tab_CandGen} shows the
conditions that must be met by \textit{Testor}, \textit{Contributes} and $J$ inputs, for each
register to receive the correct value and the priority which should be evaluated. This
operation is computed in module \textit{sel} from figure~\ref{fig:5}.

 \end{table}

The submodule $A$ from Fig.\,\ref{fig:subA} sets the attribute following the last bit setted in
the input candidate. Its outputs are the new candidate and the incremented by one $J$ value.

The submodule $E1A$  from Fig.\,\ref{fig:subEA1} comprises the \textit{Rem$\_1$} 
(Fig.\,\ref{fig:subRem1}) and $A$ submodules. 
The submodule \textit{Rem$\_1$} deletes the last attribute added to the input candidate. 
This action is performed by a priority encoder which locates the last bit setted in the input candidate. 
\textit{Rem$\_1$} outputs are the index of cleared bit: $J$ and \textit{candidate} which is the 
input candidate without the last attribute. These outputs are connected to the corresponding inputs of 
submodule $A$ to add an attribute in the corresponding position. Finally, the outputs of $E1A$ are 
the new candidate to be evaluated, and the index where the new attribute is added to the 
candidate, both outputs of $A$.

\end{figure}

Finally, submodule $E2A$ is responsible for removing the last two attributes from
input candidate, and then add the following corresponding attribute. This 
operation is performed by means of two \textit{Rem$\_1$} submodules and a submodule $A$, as 
shown in Fig.\,\ref{fig:subEA2}.

To check for algorithm termination the result of AND operation between current candidate and
the first row of the basic matrix is compared to the null $N$-tuple ($0,...,0$), as shown in 
upper right corner of Fig.\,\ref{fig:5}. In case of asserted comparison the output done is activated
 because no further combination can be a testor by not satisfying the condition over the first row.

The prototyping board used \citep{R15} allows the communication between the PC and the FPGA 
through USB port. Irreducible testors are buffered into a FIFO in order to be split into
bytes which are then buffered into a double clocked FIFO \citep{R26} to be read from the PC using 
DSTM  \citep{R25} protocol.

\section{Software Description}
\label{sect:5}

The software component works as an
interface between the user, the computer, and the FPGA board. The
input data file must be in plain text following the format shown in
Fig.\,\ref{fig:8}.

The testor computing process begins on command line program call. 
First the basic matrix is read from the input file argument. Once the
matrix is loaded into memory, the basic matrix is reorganized by 
setting the row with minimum amount of ones as the first row and
swapping columns in such a way the ones in first row appear on the left,
no matters the order between them.
Afterward, in order to complete the project files, one VHDL file
is generated and used to create a project for ISE (implementation
tool from Xilinx), which produces the programming file for the FPGA
device.

In the next stage, the interaction between hardware and software is
started. First, the board and the FPGA are located, then the device
is programmed with the bit-file obtained from the previous stage,
and both, the board and the device are initialized. Now, the
hardware architecture starts computing irreducible testors. 
Software keeps pulling through USB for new irreducible testors in the output 
FIFO until done is activate in the FPGA.

Finally irreducible testors are codified according to the original order of
columns and written to output file.

In order to show the performance of the proposed platform, it was compared against a software 
implementation of the CT-EXT algorithm and BT hardware platform from \citep{R21}. 
For experimentation purposes, BT hardware platform was modified for finding irreducible testors 
on the FPGA as we explained in section~\ref{sect:4}.

In order to understand experiments design, some ideas on algorithms and implementations must be said. 
Either CT-EXT or BT (modified) hardware implementations are capable of evaluating a candidate per clock 
cycle. If both architectures are running at the same frequency, as will be the case in our experiments, 
there are two reasons for differences in running time. The first one is the time taken to matrix 
reorganization, which is a more complex process for BT, but can be neglected as shown in \citep{R21}. 
The second and relevant one, is the amount of candidates to be evaluated. It is not a difficult task 
to find a $BM$ in which BT evaluate less candidates than CT-EXT or vice versa.

In relation to software implementation, the CT-EXT hardware platform has two disadvantages. First, 
VHDL code is generated with $BM$ data and a process of synthesis is executed previous to algorithm 
execution while this is unnecessary in software platform. Secondly, the software will be running in 
a PC at a frequency of +3GHz while FPGA architecture will be at 50MHz. 

These disadvantages make the hardware approach useful (faster) under two conditions. The algorithm 
execution must require the evaluation of a number of candidates big enough to overcome the synthesis 
overhead; and the dimensions of the $BM$ must be big enough to provide a gain in a single candidate 
evaluation. Although hardware architecture could be design for a fixed maximum matrix size and 
receive the $BM$ through USB, the size of the problem would be significantly reduced. The synthesis 
process comprehend an optimization of the design, taking advantage of $BM$ data for the reduction of 
generated hardware. The number of operations for the evaluation of a single candidate in the software 
approach is proportional to the number of rows and has a relation with the number of columns in the 
$BM$. CPU operations will be increased every time the number of attributes exceeds a multiple of 
microprocessor word width. This way we can have a gain, even at a much lower running frequency, from 
evaluating a candidate every clock cycle.

With these restrictions in mind, to show the usability of proposed platform, 
two kinds of basic matrices were randomly generated. Each type containing different amount of 1's per 
row and different amount of rows. In addition, a basic matrix obtained from real data (\textbf{CITE}) 
is solved.

Several basic matrices of different sizes were randomly generated for each kind. On hardware platforms 
the runtimes for the following stages: $BM$ input parsing and VHDL code generation, synthesis of ISE project, 
and irreducible testor computing (with a hardware frequency of 50MHz), were measured. 
Figs.\,\ref{fig:result1}, and \,\ref{fig:result2} show graphs of the whole processing time for the two kind 
of basic matrices.

Tables~\ref{sect:6} and~\ref{table:7} summarize the FPGA resources utilization on our prototyping board. 
As we can see, CT-EXT implementation is smaller than modified BT implementation. Resources utilization is 
related to $BM$ dimensions and density and to a lesser extent to data organization.

%where $f$ is the clock frequency of the architecture and $c$ is the
%percentage of candidates tested. Note that the value of $c$ is data
%dependent, i.e. it varies for each basic matrix, $BM$.
%
%It is important to notice that the processing time for computing
%irreducible testors does not only depend on the size and density of
%the $BM$, but also on the distribution of 0's and 1's inside the

%Fig\,\ref{fig:11}.

%Table\,\ref{table:5} shows the processing time for each stage of the data flow, for 45X100 low, medium, and

%the software-only implementation, for a 45X100 low density matrix and 22 times faster for the medium density
%matrix of the same size. Moreover, taking into account only the last stage of the data flow, the improvement
%over the software is 540X for the low density matrix and 39X for the medium density one. The only type of
%matrices where the proposed platform does not perform better that the software-only BT implementation was the
%high density ones, this is because of computing irreducible testors is very fast for this kind of matrices.
%The software-only implementation of BT was executed on a PC with an Intel Centrino Duo processor running at
%1.6GHz, with 1024 MB of RAM.

%The proposed platform has been designed to process variable sizes of the $BM$ matrix. The maximum size of the
%matrix that can be implemented is only limited by the available resources on the specific FPGA board. For
%example, for the Virtex-II XC2V3000 from Xilinx\cite{R14} embedded on an XtremeDSP board \citep{R15}, the
%biggest medium density matrix that can fit into the FPGA is about 100X325. Table\,\ref{table:6} summarizes
%the resource utilization for this matrix.
%
%Finally, Table\,\ref{table:7} summarizes the resource utilization
%for a 50X100 matrix for different buffer sizes on the Dismiss Testor
%module, all for the same device. Although 8 and 32 are good choices,
%16 results in a better trade-off between resource utilization (small
%when compared against the whole architecture), and the non
%irreducible testors eliminated (always over 79\%, as
%Table\,\ref{table:4} shows).

\section{Discussion}
\label{sect:7}

The proposed hardware platform provides higher processing
performance than the software implementation of the CT-EXT
algorithm for matrices used in the experimentation. 
This behaviour is possible because the hardware
component of the proposed platform is capable of testing if a 
candidate is a testor of a $BM$ in a single clock cycle,
independently of the number of columns and rows, whereas
software implementation processing time will significantly
increase for matrices with a large number of rows.

Moreover, the performance improvement is directly related to the
percentage of candidates tested ($c$), which heavily depends on
density and distribution of the values into the $BM$ matrix. This occurs in the
software as well as in the hardware implementation,
but the proposed platform also needs to synthesize the specific
architecture. For practical purposes, a concurrent approach can be used 
in computation of irreducible testors. This way, the same $BM$ is provided 
to hardware and software implementations of BT and CT-EXT algorithms at the same time. 
We can get the answer from the faster one without knowing which will be the best 
for the given data.

Experiment results show that the proposed platform allows computing
irreducible testors faster than the software implementation of
the CT-EXT algorithm, with improvements in the range of \textbf{one order} of
magnitude. However, for very large real data this improvement could
be significantly higher.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sect:8}

The high performance of the proposed platform is feasible due to the
high level of parallelism implicit in candidates evaluation of algorithms which can be
efficiently implemented on an FPGA. The proposed architecture is
capable of evaluating a testor candidate in a single clock cycle for
any $BM$ matrix, regardless of the number of columns and rows, the
only limitation being the size of the FPGA device used. The
architecture provides a good trade-off between performance and
hardware resource utilization and it is suitable to be used as a
high performance processing module in a hardware-in-the-loop
approach\cite{R16}.

Even though the proposed architecture offers an improvement compared
with a previously reported hardware implementations, further
improvements, such as testing two or more candidates per iteration,
are still possible.
